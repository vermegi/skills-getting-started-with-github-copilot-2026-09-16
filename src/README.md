| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity, or join its waitlist when it is full        |

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up
   - Ordered waitlist of student emails waiting for a spot

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
